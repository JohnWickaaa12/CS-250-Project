# CS-250-Project
This is a completed project on the Agile and Scrum practices I have learned in the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle class at SNHU.

Reflection on Agile and Scrum Practices — Sprint Review and Retrospective Project
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs begins with actively listening to stakeholders and understanding the problems they want solved. User stories are a powerful way to capture these needs by framing requirements from the user’s perspective, which helps keep development focused on delivering real value. They break down complex needs into manageable, clear, and testable chunks that the team can prioritize and implement effectively. This approach ensures that the software aligns with actual user goals rather than just technical specifications.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach program development iteratively, building small, incremental features that can be tested and improved continuously. Agile practices like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives help maintain communication, quickly adapt to changing requirements, and keep the project on track. In future work, I hope to incorporate continuous integration and regular feedback loops to enhance quality and responsiveness throughout development cycles.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating openly and respectfully, being reliable, and willing to help others. It requires active collaboration, sharing knowledge, and accepting feedback constructively. A good team member prioritizes the team’s goals over individual success and contributes positively to a supportive, productive working environment. Accountability and adaptability are also key qualities.
